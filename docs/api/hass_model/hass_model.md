# Introducing the HassModel API
This is the experimental API that are the future of NetDaemon. We are moving towards a more "C# friendly" API using constructs that are more common for C# developers. The current API will be around long enough for reasonable adoption. This API introduces alot of great stuff like not need to have a yaml file to initialize an app. The new code generated entities are not much more useful too with alot of the most common services generated for you like you would expect them to.

We will add more docs and samples as we get closer to release.
